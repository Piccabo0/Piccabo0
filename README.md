  <br/>

I am a Full Stack Developer developer in Automatic Control Field.

### My Projects
All of my projects will be released as open-source on GitHub, this includes some of my GitHub trending projects:

- [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/nothing-private) - It is an intelligent vehicle based on RFID and CV and I used Raspberry Pi 4B to develop it. Based on RFID tag and QR code, the vehicle can realize intelligent guidance function in a fixed environment. Based on infrared & ultrasonic sensor group, steering gear and USB camera, the vehicle can also realize intelligent obstacle avoidance function.
- [IoT&MSP430](https://github.com/) - It is a home intelligent henhouse monitoring and control system. I use MSP430 board to realize the interconnection of "edge, mobile and cloud terminal". At the edge, the monitoring and real-time display of environmental factors, data storage and the development of early warning system are realized. In the mobile terminal, I used QT to develop the upper computer control software, realizing the monitoring of the system by UART / TCP. On the cloud, Alibaba cloud platform is used to save and display historical data.
- [STM32](https://github.com/) - A browser extension for the Motrix Download Manager. It now has more than 9K+ users worldwide.
- [Matlab](https://github.com/) - A browser extension that adds filtering to the Github news feeds.
