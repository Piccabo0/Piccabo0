### My Projects
All of my projects will be released as open-source on GitHub, completed but not uploaded projects will also be updated:

- Raspberry Pi - CV - It is an intelligent vehicle based on RFID and CV and I used Raspberry Pi 4B to develop it. Based on RFID tag and QR code, the vehicle can realize intelligent guidance function in a fixed environment. Based on infrared & ultrasonic sensor group, steering gear and USB camera, the vehicle can also realize intelligent obstacle avoidance function.
	
- [MSP430 - IoT](https://github.com/Piccabo0/MSP430-IoT) - It is a home intelligent henhouse monitoring and control system. I use MSP430 board to realize the interconnection of "edge, mobile and cloud terminal". At the edge, the monitoring and real-time display of environmental factors, data storage and the development of early warning system are realized. In the mobile terminal, I used QT to develop the upper computer control software, realizing the monitoring of the system by UART / TCP. On the cloud, Alibaba cloud platform is used to save and display historical data.
	
- [Basys3 - FPGA ](https://github.com/Piccabo0/Basys3-FPGA) - It is a car that automatically goes back and forth between the starting line and the finish line. In the process, the car can complete corresponding actions in different sections. It has the functions of obstacle avoidance, voice control and driving state detection.
	
- [Matlab - CV](https://github.com/Piccabo0/Matlab-CV) - Analysis of flower rising trend based on the proportion of flowers of different sizes using Matlab.
	
- STM32 - IoT - An Auto Guided Vehicle which my teammates and I are doing.
